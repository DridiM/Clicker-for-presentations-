# Slide-Changer for presentations implemented in Python

This code enables you to navigate between slides in a presentation solely through hand gestures, eliminating the necessity of using a keyboard or purchasing a clicker.





## Features

- Smooth navigation to the next and previous slide.
- Freedom to move your hand in the space.
- Action requires open hands at shoulder level.
- Use the right hand to move to the next slide and the left hand to move to the previous slide.

Using this solution is straightforward. Simply run the provided code, position your laptop in front of you, and adjust the angle of the laptop's camera. During your presentation, follow these steps: to navigate to the next slide, raise your right hand to shoulder level; to navigate to the previous slide, raise your left hand to shoulder level.
